In a recent podcast appearance, Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas claimed that the company's new
AI-powered browser, "Comet," could replace recruiters and executive assistants, potentially within
six months. He stated that a week's worth of a recruiter's work, such as sourcing candidates and
sending outreach emails, could be accomplished with a single prompt.

Srinivas explained that Comet is designed to be an "AI operating system" for office work, capable of
handling a variety of tasks. For recruiters, this includes sourcing candidates, tracking their
responses in spreadsheets, managing follow-ups, and scheduling meetings. The AI would also be able
to sync with Google Calendar and resolve scheduling conflicts. Similarly, for executive assistants,
Comet could manage calendars, prepare for meetings, and triage emails.

These statements were made on The Verge's "Decoder" podcast and the Big Technology Podcast. While
the user mentioned a 6-12 month timeframe, the articles covering the news point to Srinivas
predicting these changes within the next six months. The new browser is currently in an invite-only
phase and is pitched as a tool to automate the core functions of these roles. This has added to the
ongoing debate about whether AI will augment the existing workforce or replace human jobs.
