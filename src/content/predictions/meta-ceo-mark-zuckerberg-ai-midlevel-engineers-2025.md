Mark Zuckerberg predicted during his interview with Joe Rogan that within 2025, Meta and other
AI-focused companies will develop AI capable of functioning effectively as midlevel software
engineers, proficient in coding. He noted that while initially costly to deploy, over time, a
substantial portion of code within Meta's applications, including the AI itself, will be generated
by AI engineers rather than human counterparts.

Zuckerberg highlighted this as a pivotal moment in software development, fundamentally altering how
software is created. He projected that AI agents will match the coding and problem-solving
capabilities of skilled midlevel engineers starting in 2025, with broader deployment expected in
2026 and beyond. While he didn't foresee immediate replacement of all midlevel engineers by AI, he
suggested that a majority of coding tasks would transition to AI, potentially reducing the demand
for human engineers at that level.

In essence, Zuckerberg envisions AI assuming many coding responsibilities currently handled by
midlevel engineers by the end of this year, signaling a significant transformation in the software
engineering landscape and productivity.
